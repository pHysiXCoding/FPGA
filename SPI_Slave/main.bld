INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'clk50_grp', used in period specification
   'TS_PER_CLK50', was traced into PLL_ADV instance PLL_ADV. The following new
   TNM groups and period specifications were generated at the PLL_ADV output(s):
    
   CLKOUT0: <TIMESPEC TS_clknetwork_clkout0 = PERIOD "clknetwork_clkout0"
